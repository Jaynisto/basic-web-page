                I would Like to visit to <b>Cologne</b> because it is home to one of the most impressive cathedrals in the world, a thriving art scene, and some of the most high-spirited locals, Cologne makes for a delightful European city break, whether you’re looking for culture, entertainment, or pampering thermal baths.
                It is the fourth largest city in Germany and one of its most libertine destinations, alongside Berlin.
                The most beautiful sights in Cologne include its UNESCO-listed cathedral (Kölner Dom); the Hohenzollern Bridge, famous for its love padlocks; the Altstadt (Old Town), with its lovely historical buildings and monuments; as well as the fashionable areas of Agnesviertel and the Belgian Quarter.
                If you happen to be in Cologne in November, don't miss the Cologne Carnival. It is widely considered one of the greatest street festivals in Europe, and maybe the world.
